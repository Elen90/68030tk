This project consists of an layout and PCB of an CPU replacement board for 68000-DIP based Systems. Its basicly build for an Amiga but could be used elsewhere.

The hardware manly solves these tasks:

FPU integration
Adaptation of the 68030-protocoll to the 68000-protocoll
E-Clock-Generation
DMA-Bussizing for 16-bit DMA access
An expansionport for further developement

It contains two folders:

1. a PCB for the Hardware 
2. a Logic core for the adaptation

Have fun developping it!
